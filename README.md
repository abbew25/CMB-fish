# Description 

This code is based off the GoFish code, but I have adapted it to compute the Fisher information for the temperature fluctuations in the CMB. This script can produce Fisher matrix forecasts for the following cosmological parameters:

$$100\theta_s$$, $$100\omega_b$$, $$\omega_{c}$$, $$\ln{(10^{10} A_s)}$$, $$n_s$$, $$\tau$$. It can also optionally do forecasts for $$\sum m_{\nu}$$, and for phase shift related parameters:

$$A_{\phi}$$, which parameterizes the amplitude of the phase shift due to free-streaming standard model neutrinos, and $$G_{\mathrm{eff}}$$, the strength of neutrino self-interactions in a model with universal self-interactions, which has been included in a template for the phase shift.
